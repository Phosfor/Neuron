# Neuron
A little neuronal network example written in Python.
This is not using any framework like Tensorflow.

This is something I have done about 7 years ago and I don't intend to put more work into it.
The only reason I am uploading it to github now is because I was asked to do so and the old download-link is now broken.

If yo want to see it in action you can check it out here: https://youtu.be/7DC8fS2Lf78
